        <h2>Why I Like to Eat Red Crayons</h2>
        
        <p>There's something uniquely satisfying about red crayons. Maybe it's the bold color, rich like cherries or ripe strawberries, that draws me in. While others may reach for candy or chips, I find comfort in the waxy snap of a red crayon.</p>
        
        <p>It's not just about taste—it's about the experience. The soft texture and nostalgic scent remind me of childhood art sessions, where creativity had no limits. Eating a red crayon feels like a tiny rebellion, a harmless detour from the ordinary. It's quirky, unexpected, and undeniably mine.</p>
        
        <p>Of all the colors, red is the most passionate—it screams confidence and energy. That's the flavor I crave, both in life and in crayons. Sure, people raise eyebrows, but that just makes it better. Eating red crayons isn't just a habit—it's a statement. It says, "I'm not afraid to be different," and in a world of rules, that's deliciously freeing.</p>
