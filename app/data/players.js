        <h2>Balenax the Warlock</h2>
        
        <p>Balenax the Warlock is not your average wielder of shadow and flame. Hailing from the chaotic depths of the Twisting Nether, he's mastered dark pacts, summoned infernals, and twisted the fabric of souls—but his true passion? Crayons.</p>
        
        <p>That's right—between flinging shadow bolts and siphoning life, Balenax can often be found hunched over parchment in his dark tower, furiously scribbling with a bright orange crayon named "Sizzling Ember." While others fear him for his demonic powers, his minions whisper of a softer side—one that doodles fel imps with hearts and flowers.</p>

        <h2>About Covert</h2>
        
        <p>Some hunters track beasts.<br>
        Some hunters track glory.<br>
        Covert tracks only the finest vintage of Crayons, preferably aged in a warm leather quiver for maximum flavor.</p>
        
        <p>In the chaotic world of Azeroth, survival hinges on instincts — and mine have led me to a groundbreaking discovery: Crayons are the ultimate source of power. Vibrant, chewy, slightly suspicious in texture — they fuel my shots, sharpen my senses, and brighten my day, one waxy mouthful at a time.</p>
        
        <p>I highly advise everyone, adventurer and commoner alike, to embrace the Crayon diet.<br>
        Forget elixirs, buffs, and mystical scrolls. Want to one-shot a boss?<br>
        Chomp a "Royal Purple."<br>
        Need to dodge a mechanic?<br>
        Nibble a "Forest Green."<br>
        Feeling low on mana?<br>
        Munch a "Sky Blue" and taste the arcane.</p>
        
        <p>Trust me, I'm an expert.<br>
        After all, you can't spell Covert without Covering your mouth in delicious Crayon residue.</p>
        
        <p>Remember:<br>
        Taste the rainbow. Fear the hunter.<br>
        And always — always — go for the glitter ones when available.</p>
